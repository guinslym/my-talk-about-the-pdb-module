### Installation packages
Note: For the package pdbpp you will need to install it by your self **pip install pdbpp** because it overwrites teh pdb module. So when you will import pdb you will have new commands. it's better to not install it and look what pdb offers and other packages too then you can install **pdbpp** later.
