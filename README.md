	git clone git@github.com:guinslym/my-talk-about-the-pdb-module.git
	cd my-talk-about-the-pdb-module
	Open **presentation.html** in your browser 

### Installation packages
Note: For the package pdbpp you will need to install it by your self **pip install pdbpp** because it overwrites teh pdb module. So when you will import pdb you will have new commands. it's better to not install it and look what pdb offers and other packages too then you can install **pdbpp** later.

	pip install requirements_windows.txt
